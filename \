title: Building a new keyboard

So on <span class="green hover">Christmas Eve</span> I decided to spoil myself and get a new keyboard, the <a href="https://www.keychron.com/pages/keychron-k8-wireless-mechanical-keyboard" class="cyan hover">Keychron K8</a>.

I bought the barebones version, as I wanted custom keycaps and switches. I bought the <a class="hover blue" href="https://www.keychron.com/products/cherry-mx2a-switch-set?variant=40590476542041">Cherry MX2A Blue</a> from keychron for about $40. As for the keycaps, I went with the <a class="hover lime" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B51DHCXN?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details">Botanical Garden Keycaps</a>.

The Keychron K8 is both wireless or wired with hotswappable keyswitches. It has RGB backlight and can connect up to <span class="red hover">three</span> devices. It also has a switch in the back for Mac OS or Windows mode so you can access Siri or Cortana!
