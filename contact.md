### Pets

Whiskey is my favorite cat as I have gotten her as a therapy cat. She loves stealing food and will greet anyone!

This is the very sassy Winter. We are currently fostering her until her owner gets a place of his own. She has a beautiful white coat and she loves to bully Whiskey. She is still very young and loves to play. She requires a human to watch her eat, as she is very picky.
