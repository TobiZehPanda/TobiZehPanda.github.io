At the time of this post, Whiskey is 3 years old. Whiskey Mia Whumpus is my chonky dilute calico that loves food. She will whine constantly for food, as she has an endless void for a stomach. She has a black dot on her nose and has beautiful colours. She loves to sit in her windows perch and stare out the window. She currently weighs 10.7 pounds or 4.85kg.

As a kitten, she loves to bump her head on her `servants`, putting them in line. Rarely she will use her teeth, unless she gets too excited.
