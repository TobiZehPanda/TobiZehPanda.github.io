So in the event of boredom, I bought a router off of <span class="indigo">Amazon</span>. I had the hopes of installing a custom firmware on it called <a href="https://advancedtomato.com" class="red hover">Advanced Tomato</a>. The benefits of installing a custom firmware on a router, is that you get a more secure and modern UI, with more configurations. Some custom firmware includes:

* Advanced Tomato
* Fresh Tomato
* DD-WRT
* OpenWrt
* Merlin

Sadly enough, Netgear has patched the firmware updates too a newer version. So you can't directly upgrade to Advanced Tomato. It now requires some bootleg hacking to downgrade it. I used this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUZouixjko0" class="pink hover">tutorial</a> I found on youtube to help downgrade the firmware. It required a bit of work to downgrade. This is the <span class="teal">risky</span> part. If you try to flash the wrong firmware or too big of file, you may brick the router, causing it to be useless.

After downgrading a few times, you can now install a custom firmware called <a href="https://www.asuswrt-merlin.net" class="yellow hover">Merlin</a>. After Merlin is installed. You can now flash the Advanced Tomato firmware.

When I finished configuring the router, I enabled adblock with the blacklist from <a href="https://firebog.net" class="orange hover">firebog</a>.
